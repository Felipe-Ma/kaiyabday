      <h1>A Little Note for a Special Girl </h1>
      <article class="note">
        <p>Hi baby girl,</p>
        <p>HAPPY 23RD BIRTHDAY!! As always, I hope you enjoy your gifts. They took sweat, tears, and most importantly, my precious time! Just kidding lol.</p>
        <p>Thank you for always filling my days with joy, your craziness, laughter, and memories that I want to relive for the rest of my life. I feel like we are still so young, yet have truly done so much together that it feels like a lifetime. I love you so much for experiencing so much of life with me, and I can't wait to see what more memories we create before the end of this year!</p>
        <p>I am so proud of the person that you are and how you have evolved over the past few years. You are truly such a hard-working, dependent on Felipe Martinez, woman. I admire the amount of effort you put into yourself, and the hard, long work and school nights that you consistently put in to better yourself. I am so happy that you have been chasing your dreams and aspirations, and know that one day you will be the best teacher that any kid can ask for.</p>
        <p>I love you more than words on this page can say. Here is to more adventures, flights, late-night movies, talks, and photos that we will cherish 4ever.</p>
        <p>With all of my love,<br>Felipe :)</p>
